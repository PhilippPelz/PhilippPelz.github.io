Our new article for imaging in multiply scattering materials was just published in  [Physical Review Research](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023159). 
We formulate a phase retrieval algorithm for the S-matrix that does not depend on sample crystallinity, and demonstrate it experimentally at atomic resolution with a complex, multiply scattering structure.
