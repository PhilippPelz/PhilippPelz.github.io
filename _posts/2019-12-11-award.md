I was awarded the [2020 M&M Postdoctoral Scholar Award](https://www.microscopy.org/awards/2020_postdoctoralscholars.cfm) for my paper titled "Phase Contrast Imaging in Thick, Heterogeneous Samples
via S-Matrix Phase Retrieval and Depth Sectioning". A preprint of this work is available [on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12768). In collaboration with Hamish Brown, we demonstrated
depth-resolved atomic-resolution imaging of oxygen atoms in a thick heterostructure. The preprint is available [on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07652).
