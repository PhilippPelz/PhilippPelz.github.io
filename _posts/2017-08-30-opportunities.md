I have started a new position as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Scott Lab](https://scott.mse.berkeley.edu/) in the [Materials Sciences department at UC Berkeley](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/). I will also be affiliated with the [National Center for Electron Microscopy](http://foundry.lbl.gov/facilities/ncem/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and working with [Colin Ophus](http://foundry.lbl.gov/facilities/ncem/staff.html#/people/colin_ophus.html).
I will be working on atomic resolution electron tomography, computational phase contrast methods in 2 and 3 dimensions, and optimal experimental design.
