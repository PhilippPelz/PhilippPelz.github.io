My new article was just published in Scientific Reports: [Low-dose cryo electron ptychography via non-convex Bayesian optimization](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07488-y)

In the article we compare the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in scanning diffraction microscopy with the conventional imaging methods in cryo-EM, namely defocus-based phase contrast and phase contrast with a Zernike phase plate. We show that a 100-fold improvement in SNR at 3Ã… resolution can be achieved. With the advent of fast direct electron detectors with frame rates in the kHz range, ptychography is becoming feasible and may offer significant improvements over conventional methods.
