I am a PhD student in the Group of [Prof. Dwayne Miller](http://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en/research/ard/ard) at the [Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter](http://www.mpsd.mpg.de/70729/liquid_to_solid_group) in Hamburg. I work on extending the spatio-temporal resolution limits of electron microscopy via computational and machine learning methods.

Prior to that I took part in the triple-degree [Master in material science exploring large scale facilities](https://www.mamaself.eu/) program and received Master degrees in Engineering Physics, Materials Science and Chemistry, all with high distinction. For my Masters thesis I worked at the [CSAXS beamline](https://www.psi.ch/sls/csaxs/) at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/) in Switzerland, developing [On-the-fly scans for X-ray ptychography](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4904943?journalCode=apl).
I was a DESY summer student in [Henry Chapman's group](https://cid.cfel.de/) after receiving my undergrad in Physics.
I did my undergraduate in Physics and Computer Science at [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/).
During my undergrad I worked as a software engineer at [Interasco GmbH](https://www.interasco.de/en), developing enterprise software for intellectual property management.
For my third year project in Physics I worked with Dr. Thorsten Weber at the [Ultrafast X-Ray Science Laboratory](http://ultrafast.lbl.gov/) in Berkeley, where I designed and built a 3D momentum spectrometer for [coulomb-explosion imaging of small molecules](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.89.013403). My third year project in Computer Science involved numerical optimization of scan positions in ptychography.

Prior to my studies I worked as a backend software engineer at [Swinton Insurance](https://www.swinton.co.uk/) in Manchester.
